# GeminiAddressAdder
A simple Python Client to "bulk add" withdrawal addresses to Gemini Exchange using a csv file.

To use this just add your API Key and API Secret then create a csv file named "addresses.txt" with the network and the addresses you want and save it in the same folder as the script.

example: 

Ethereum,0xF833a5db28340a6C3C35Fdf532A2CFC6277A03eD

I'm not responsible for anything you do with this. Use at your own risk.

Feel free to add other features if you want but this is really just a quick and dirty way to avoid a lot of copy paste drama.
